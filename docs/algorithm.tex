\section{Problem space}

The number of possible permutations of sub tasks within the sprints is
$$n = (n_{team} \cdot n_{sprint}) ^{\sum_{i=0}^{n_{task}}{w_i}} $$ where
\begin{itemize}
\item n - number of possible solutions
\item $n_{team}$ - number of teams
\item $n_{sprint}$ - number of sprints
\item $n_{task}$ - number of planned tasks
\item $w_i$ - work of given task
\end{itemize}

In our example we will get $n = (5 \cdot 11) ^{280} = 1.6 \cdot 10^{687}$.
For comparison - the estimated number of atoms in the known universe is around $10^{80}$

\paragraph{Let's consider a more realistic example:}

\begin{itemize}
\item 5.000 story points (50 projects 100 SP each)
\item 16 sprints (a year)
\item 6 teams
\end{itemize}

This will result in problem space $n = (6 \cdot 16) ^{5000} = 2.2 \cdot 10^{9911}$.
Looks like we are going to have to optimize a bit in order to be able to get some usable solution in reasonable time (smaller than few billion years).

\section{Optimization}

The problem space is so huge, that I beliewe, that we will only get usable results in meaningful time when the construction heuristics already delivers the "optimal" solution.


For this we will have to pre-sort the tasks correctly. This can be done by implementing a task difficulty comparator and use FIRST\_FIT\_DECREASING construction heuristics. The difficulty comparator sorts by following rules (descending priority):

\begin{itemize}
\item blockers should be planned before blocked tasks
\item projects which are due earlier should be planned before projects due later.
\item projects which have higher costs of delay should be planned before projects with lower costs of delay
\item we might need to take project size into consideration as well
\end{itemize}
